# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

### The Business Goals of the Website

To provide an online store suppling western wear to the Irish market. A resurgance of popularity in country music and shows like Yellowstone and Nashville, have made popular American brands sought after in Ireland. Many of these brands are currently unavailable to Irish audiences and so I believe there is a gap in the market for a shop specializing in western clothing.

### Agile Methodology

The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Github and developed throughout the project. 

Through the use of the Kanban board in the projects view in Github, the project was divided into a few different sections - To Do, In Progress and Done. 

Github issues were used to create User Stories for the project. This is where the project user was assigned; labels were added to show at a glance importance of tasks and help prioritize jobs. User story was added to the appropriate Iteration and the project [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/ciaralynch72/projects/5).

## Structure

## Design

The design was centered around colors and imagery typically associated with the wild west. 



## Skeleton 

### Wireframes 
Southern Outfitters Ltd. was based upon Boutique Ado layout. I took aspects of what I liked about this and personalized it 
to how I like to view information. The layout is extremly simple. 
To be finished...

### Database modal

The database model is simple and follows along the basis of the the boutique database structure. 

![Database Structure]() Need to finish

### Colours

The colors were chosen based on what colors are typically associated with western lifestyles. 

- Turqoise

In Western culture, turquoise is beloved far and wide. For Native American tribes, turquoise was a foundation in their culture and spirituality dating back as early as the 5th century. The unique color of the stone represented protection, power, wealth, and health for native cultures.

- Yellow and Orange

These were chosen as sunsets are depicated all across western culture through the great plains of Montana and down to Texas and beyond. 

- Brown and Dark Green

These colors were chosen as they symobilse the earth and grass which is the core essense of western lifestyle. Afterall the west was born from those seeking elusive lands they could only dream about.

### Typography 

The typography that was used was chosen was Inconsolata and Wellfleet as I had wanted to use something that would give the site visitor a familiar western feel with the old time lettering. 
### Imagery 

I created the main store graphic on canva and used unsplash and pexel to obtain the rest.

## Bugs
I came across quite a few bugs while creating this project. A lot of them were typing errors, getting my URL paths correct, calling the wrong template, adding modules to installed apps. Alot of them actually helped me get a better understanding of what exactly I am at and they were important learning curves. 
My newly aquired bootstrap skills also were the fault of some bugs which I was able to rectify for the most part. 

* After setting up the countryfield and having previously added orders to the site I could not restart the site as my order had exceeded the country field limit. I was able to rectify this by deleting the previous orders and then making the migrations 
![CountryField Bug](media/assets/readme_images/bug_countryfield.JPG)

* Deleting a test entry that was in my shopping cart made my site not load. After going to slack I found out that I needed to delete the session cache and then the site loaded as normal
![Categories Error] Add photo

* Webhook handler was not showing as successful on the Strip site. After double/triple checking code I went to slack and found that the reason it was not working was that my workspace was not shared with Stripe. Sharing my workspace fixed this bug.
